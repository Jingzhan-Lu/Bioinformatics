GWAS Control Selection for Bioinformatics Journal
This repository contains R scripts used in the analysis for our manuscript submitted to Bioinformatics Journal. The primary aim of this codebase is to perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using two different control selection strategies:
Matched Controls: Cases are matched to controls based on predefined criteria (e.g. age, genetoping chips, recruitment centre, genetics PCs, etc.)
Random Selection: Controls are randomly selected from the general population without matching.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
R version â‰¥ 4.0

Required packages:
dplyr
data.table
optmatch
ggplot2
MatchIt (for propensity score matching)

You can install required packages via:
install.packages(c("dplyr", "data.table", "ggplot2"))
# For matching:
install.packages("MatchIt")
# Or:
# install.packages("optmatch")

Usage
1. Matched Control Selection
source("matched_controls/select_matched_controls.R")
# This will generate a matched case-control dataset using nearest neighbor or propensity score matching.
2. Random Control Selection
source("random_controls/select_random_controls.R")
# This will randomly select controls from a specified eligible population.

3. Downstream GWAS
Both scripts output .csv or .rds files that can be used in downstream GWAS analysis with tools such as plink, or REGENIEE.

Output
Matched or random control dataset (data.frame)
Summary tables (case/control counts, demographics)
eQQ plots (e.g., distribution of covariates before/after matching)
